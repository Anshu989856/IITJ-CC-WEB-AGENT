You can view the update status under\nSettings\nGeneral\nUpdates\nin the ownCloud Desktop App. If an update is available and has been successfully downloaded, the ownCloud Desktop app starts a silent update prior to its next launch and then restarts itself. macOS\nIf a new update is available, the ownCloud Desktop app initializes a\npop-up dialog\nto alert you of the update and requests that you update to the latest version. The ownCloud Desktop app on a Linux operating system does not perform any updates on its own. Preventing Automatic Updates in Windows Environments\nUsers may disable automatic updates by adding this line to the\n[General]\nsection of their\nowncloud.cfg\nfiles:\nowncloud.cfg\nis usually located in\nC:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\ownCloud\\owncloud.cfg\n. (64-bit-Windows) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\ownCloud\\ownCloud\nAdd the key\nskipUpdateCheck\n(of type DWORD).

Your key names look like this:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\myCompanyName\\myAppName\nPreventing Automatic Updates in macOS Environments\nYou can disable the automatic update mechanism, in the macOS operating system, by copying the file\nowncloud.app/Contents/Resources/deny_autoupdate_com.owncloud.desktopclient.plist\nto\n/Library/Preferences/com.owncloud.desktopclient.plist\n. However, if you want to disable it, edit your Desktop App configuration file:\n$HOME/.config/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg\n.

Basic Workflow\nThe following sections describe how to use the Automatic Updater on different operating systems. Administrative privileges are required to perform the update. Preventing Automatic Updates\nIn controlled environments, such as companies or universities, you might not want to enable the auto-update mechanism, as it interferes with controlled deployment tools and policies. To address this case, it is possible to disable the auto-updater entirely. The following sections describe how to disable the auto-update mechanism for different operating systems. skipUpdateCheck=true\nWindows administrators have more options for preventing automatic updates in Windows environments by using one of two methods. The first method allows users to override the automatic update check mechanism, whereas the second method prevents any manual overrides. To prevent automatic updates, but allow manual overrides:\nEdit these Registry keys:\na. To manually override this key, use the same value in\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\n. To prevent automatic updates and disallow manual overrides:\nThis is the preferred method of controlling the updater behavior using Group Policies. Preventing Automatic Updates in Linux Environments\nBecause the Linux Desktop App does not provide automatic updating functionality, there is no need to remove the automatic-update check."

When planning to upgrade from a Desktop app release ⇐ 2.5 to a release >=5.0 you must make an intermediary step to release 4.0 before doing the final upgrade. Should the silent update fail, the Desktop app offers a manual download. Linux\nLinux distributions provide their own update tools. The client will inform you (\nSettings\nGeneral\nUpdates\n) when an update is available. Updates are in-place and do not produce a new file name."
