This allows users to search not only for file names but also for content within files stored in ownCloud. The\nFull Text Search\napp integrates full text search into ownCloud, powered by Elasticsearch. This document describes how to setup the ownCloud part of the Full Text Search app. Prerequisites\nA fully functioning\nElasticsearch Server 7\n. Version 1.0.0 of the Full Text Search app only works with Elasticsearch version 5.6. With version >=2.0.0 of the app, Elasticsearch version > 7 is required and has been tested and is supported up to version 8.6.2 though newer versions may work without any issues. The\nIngest Attachment Processor Plugin\nlets Elasticsearch extract metadata and text from over a thousand different file types such as PPT, XLS, PDF and more. To install the processor, run the following command from your Elasticsearch installation directory:\nsudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-attachment\nPost installing the Plugin, you need to restart the Elasticsearch server:\nsudo service elasticsearch restart\nInstallation\nTo install the app, use the Marketplace app on your ownCloud server or proceed manually:\nDownload and extract the tarball of the\nFull Text Search app\nto the apps directory (or\ncustom apps directory, prefered\n) of your ownCloud instance. Use the\nApp Commands\nto enable the\nsearch_elastic\napplication with:\nsudo -u www-data ./occ app:enable search_elastic\nor enable it via the GUI\nSettings\nAdmin\nApps\nFull Text Search\nEnable\n. Configuration\nTo configure the Full Text Search, go to\nSettings\nAdmin\nSearch\n. Setting this checkmark not only enables search in external storages, but also search in federated shares. The command needs to be run for all  users, or at least the ones using the search app. Anyway, good results are expected to be on top. Examples:\nList app settings\nsudo -u www-data ./occ config:list search_elastic\n{\n\"apps\": {\n\"search_elastic\": {\n\"enabled\": \"yes\",\n\"group\": \"content_searchers\",\n\"installed_version\": \"2.1.0\",\n\"nocontent\": \"false\",\n\"scanExternalStorages\": \"1\",\n\"servers\": \"elastic:xxxxxxx@172.17.0.3:9200\",\n\"types\": \"filesystem\"\n}\n}\n}\nSet app options\nsudo -u www-data ./occ config:app:set \\\nsearch_elastic scanExternalStorages --value 0\nor\nsudo -u www-data ./occ config:app:set \\\nsearch_elastic scanExternalStorages --value 1\nApp Modes\nThe Full Text Search app provides two modes, which are\nactive\nand\npassive\n. Search results will be based on Elasticsearch. Search functionality based on ownCloud core database queries will no longer be used. Search results will still be based on ownCloud core database queries. Changing the App Mode\nsudo -u www-data ./occ config:app:set \\\nsearch_elastic mode --value passive\nor\nsudo -u www-data ./occ config:app:set \\\nsearch_elastic mode --value active\nRestrict Search Results\nIndex Metadata Only\nIf you only want to use the Full Text Search app as a more scalable search on filenames, you can disable content indexing by setting the option\nnocontent\nto\ntrue\n, which defaults to\nfalse\n:\nsudo -u www-data ./occ config:app:set \\\nsearch_elastic nocontent --value true\nYou have to reindex all files if you change this back to\nfalse\n. It may be a more flexible way to go with limiting full text search to certain groups by setting the option\ngroup.nocontent\n, see\nbelow\nfor details. Limit Metadata Search for Groups\nIf you only want to use search for shared filenames, you can disable full text search for specific groups by setting the option\ngroup.nocontent\nto the groups whose users should\nonly\nreceive results based on filenames (not the full path), like users in the group\nnofulltext\nas in the example below:\nsudo -u www-data ./occ config:app:set \\\nsearch_elastic group.nocontent \\\n--value nofulltext\nYou can also configure multiple groups by separating them with comma:\nsudo -u www-data ./occ config:app:set \\\nsearch_elastic group.nocontent \\\n--value nofulltext,anothergroup,\"group with blanks\"\nThis allows a scalable search in shared files without clouding the results with content based hits. Depending on using\nactive\nor\npassive\nmode, you either have to:\nactive mode\n: wait until the job has finished and search is available to users, or\npassive mode\n: users continue to search with ownCloud embedded search and you switch over to active mode when the occ command has finished indexing. User Manual\nTo find out more about the usage, check out the section in the User Manual:\nSearch & Full Text Search\n. Search does currently not work when encrypting files via the encryption app."

After checking everything is good, you can remove the old\nLegacy\nconnector from the list of write connectors. This is expected to be slower. Note that step 2 just takes care of new files. This is why step 3 is there. Step 4 is important and you should stop at that point for a while. If something goes wrong, you can still revert things, in particular, you can switch back to the\nLegacy\nconnector. From step 5 the actions are irreversible. If you want to go back, youâ€™ll have to start a new migration. Itâ€™s important to notice there isnâ€™t any expected downtime while the migration happens. This step is important, because the red dot will turn green showing that everything has been set up correctly. System cron is recommended, otherwise a lot of jobs might queue up."

For details see the\nCreate API key API\nat the ES documentation. Known Limitations\nCurrently, the app has the following known limitations:\nIf a shared file is renamed by the sharee (share receiver), the sharee cannot find the file using the new filename. The app does not return results for recieved federated share files.

Note that this setting requires to rebuild the index. Connector Setup\nThere are 2 different indexes. The difference between the two is how index data is stored because both provide different capabilities and index in different ways. To populate the new connector with enhanced capabilities, an occ command needs to be run for each user, creating index data accordingly. See the occ command section\nFill a Secondary Index\nfor more details. If you have indexed data already, use the following steps to migrate to the new index scheme:\nAssuming you have the\nLegacy\nconnector set up for\nwrite\nand\nsearch\n. Finally you can completely remove the old index from Elasticsearch. With step 2, you will be writing into both indexes at the same time. Files indexed previously wonâ€™t be present in the new index. In this case, use the occ command referenced above with the\nLegacy\nindex. Until step 4, the\nLegacy\nconnector will keep updating the index normally. New files should appear first though this is not a guarantee because the score of a file could be too low. Save the Configuration\nSave the configuration with the\nSave configuration\nbutton. Set up the ES Index\nWhen everything is set up, you can click the button\nSetup index\nwhich will tell the ES server to create the plain empty index and other related internal settings. Resetting the ES Index\nYou can at any time reset the index if required by clicking on\nReset index\nor with an occ command. The index will be recreated afterwards. sudo -u www-data ./occ search:index:reset\nUsing occ Commands\nYou can use the:\nocc Full Text Search command set\nto manage the app. These commands let administrators\ncreate\n,\nrebuild\n,\nreset\n, and\nupdate\nthe search index. For example, the following command resets and recreates the index for all users:\nsudo -u www-data ./occ search:index:reset\nocc Config Commands command set\nto configure the app. Active Mode\nAfter enabling the app, it will be by default in\nactive mode\nFile changes will be indexed in background jobs. Active mode can cause a downtime for search when indexing starts on an already heavily used instance, because it takes a while until all files have been indexed. Passive Mode\nTo do an initial full indexing without the app interfering, it can be put in\npassive\nmode\nThe administrator can run occ commands changing the search configuration without notice to the users. The app will not index any changes by itself. Setting it to\ntrue\ndoes not require reindexing. Create the Index\nWhen everything has been set up and configured, you can initiate creating the index. This must be done with an occ command. sudo -u www-data ./occ search:index:create\nIssues\nWhen the Elasticsearch server is down or the index has not been set up, you may get the following message. Check if the ES server is reachable or if the index was set up properly as one solution to fix the issue. Search results are not updated when a text file is rolled back to an earlier version."

The Legacy doesnâ€™t differ from the current search while the RelevanceV2 has new capabilities. Migrating to the RelevanceV2 Connector:\nIf you havenâ€™t indexed anything yet, you are encouraged to set up the connectors you want to use as part of the app configuration.

When the switch happens in the search connector, the new\nRelevanceV2\nconnector will access the new index, which should have been fully updated. Enhanced Search Capabilities with RelevanceV2\nThe RelevanceV2 can boost scores of recently modified files. Even with the boost, files could score less than older but more relevant files. Additional searches you can do with the \"RelevanceV2\" connector:\nSearch by extension\next:pdf\n,\next:docx\n,\next:gif\n,\next:mp4\n,\next:tar.gz\n,\next:gz\n, etc., any extension is possible\nSearch by size, only in bytes or megabytes\nSearch by byte size:\nsize.b:<8092\n,\nsize.b:>102400\n,\nsize.b:[8092 TO 16184]\nSearch by megabyte size:\nsize.mb:<3\n,\nsize.mb:>9\n,\nsize.mb:[3 TO 9]\nSearch by type: only \"file\" or \"folder\"\ntype:file\n,\ntype:folder\nSearch by date:\nSearch by timestamp:\nmtime:<1678960862\n,\nmtime:>1678960862\n,\nmtime:[1608111372 TO 1678960862]\nSearch by date:\nmtime:<2021-08-25\n,\nmtime:>2023-01-18\n,\nmtime:[2022-01-01 TO 2022-12-31]\nSearch by mimetype:\nmime:image\n,\nmime:gif\n,\nmime:text\nNOTE: To search for the whole mimetype such as \"image/gif\" use\nmime.key:image\\/gif\n.
