OWNCLOUD_HTTP2_ENABLED\ndepend on Qt version\nForce-enable (\"1\") or force-disable (\"0\") HTTP2 support. OWNCLOUD_SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE\ndepends on filesystem\nSet a specific sqlite journal mode.

OWNCLOUD_TARGET_CHUNK_UPLOAD_DURATION\n60000\nTarget duration in milliseconds for chunk uploads. The client adjusts the chunk size until each chunk upload takes approximately this long. Set to 0 to disable dynamic chunk sizing. OWNCLOUD_CHUNKING_NG\ndepend on server capability\nForce-enable (\"1\") or force-disable (\"0\") the NG chunking algorithm.
