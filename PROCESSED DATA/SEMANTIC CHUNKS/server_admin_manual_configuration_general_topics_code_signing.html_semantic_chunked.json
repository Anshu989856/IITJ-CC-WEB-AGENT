In\nthe past, invalid updates were a significant source of errors when\nupdating ownCloud. All the possible errors and their explanations can be found\nhere\nFAQ\nWhy Did ownCloud Add Code Signing? Do We Lock Down ownCloud? The ownCloud project is open source and always will be. We do not want\nto make it more difficult for our users to run ownCloud. Any code\nsigning errors on upgrades will not prevent ownCloud from running, but\nwill display a warning on the Admin page. The ownCloud project is open source and always will be. The code check for the\ncore parts of ownCloud is enabled when the ownCloud release version\nbranch has been set to stable. For custom distributions of ownCloud it is recommended to change the\nrelease version branch in version.php to something else than \"stable\".
