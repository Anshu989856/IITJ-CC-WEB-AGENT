When you’re happy with your photo selection, click\nUpload\nand the photo(s) will be uploaded.

So no reason to worry if you see different file sizes in the desktop client and on your mobile device. Any file type\nsupported by iOS Safari\ncan be displayed in the app. Depending on the file type, the image will be able to viewed, or an icon for it, along with some file details, will be displayed.

However, files can be sorted in ascending and descending order by name, type, size, date, and shared. If you press the Sort by menu, you can change sort method and order. The first time you change the sort category, files and folders are sorted using that category in ascending order. If you choose that category a second time, the sort order is inverted.
