Do not change any of those settings except support advises you to do so. Location of the Configuration File\nThe location of the configuration file depends on the operating system used. Incorrect settings can produce unintended results. Note that the default values are always set and used unless you change them. The Desktop App will dynamically adjust this size within the maximum and minimum bounds (see below). This option only works on linux\nshowExperimentalOptions\nfalse\nWhether to show experimental options that are still undergoing testing in the user interface. Turning this on does not enable experimental behavior on its own. It does enable user interface options that can be used to opt in to experimental features."

This enforcement ensures that there is a mandatory synchronization independent of the server’s polling response. fullLocalDiscoveryInterval\n3600000\n(1h)\nThe interval in milliseconds after which the Desktop app will perform a full local discovery.
