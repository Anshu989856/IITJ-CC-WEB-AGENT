They can use one or more accounts for the same server, or accounts for other ownCloud servers they have access to. This opens the \"\nAdd Account\n\" dialog, where you can enter the URL of the ownCloud server. You will then be redirected to the ownCloud server, where you can supply your username and password. ownCloud server must have\nthe OAuth2 app\ninstalled, configured, and enabled to use Two-Factor Authentication. Please contact your ownCloud administrator for more details. You will then be able to change the ownCloud server URL, and manage the authentication credentials.

Authentication Methods\nThe iOS app supports two ways of authentication options for user accounts. These are:\nBasic Authentication\nOAuth 2.0\nAuthentication Options\nBasic Authentication\nLogin Credentials are stored on the device (secured in the iOS system keychain). OAuth 2.0\nThe OAuth2 implementation uses\nSFAuthenticationSession\n, which is described as a best practice by\nRFC 8252\n- when running under iOS 11. Under iOS 12, the OAuth2 implementation uses\nASWebAuthenticationSession\n, which is the successor of\nSFAuthenticationSession\n. Additionally, OAuth2 is the industry standard authorisation method, and the username and password are not stored on the device. How the authentication credentials can be managed depends on the authentication type. Basic Authentication\nOAuth2 Authentication\nThe user is authenticated using Basic Authentication. In this setup, they will be able to enter\na different password, as well as delete their authentication data. The user is authenticated using OAuth2 authentication. In this setup, they will only be able\nto delete their OAuth2 authentication."

After you enter it and click \"Continue\", the iOS app checks the authentication method and the validity of the SSL/TLS certificate (\nif the server URL uses the HTTPS protocol\n).
