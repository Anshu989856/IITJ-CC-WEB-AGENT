The first time you log into a new ownCloud account, you’ll see a screen with a download link to the ownCloud Android App in the\nGoogle Play Store\n. Users of customized ownCloud Android apps, for example from their employer, should follow their employer’s instructions. Upgrading\nWhen you download your ownCloud Android App from the Google Play store, it will be upgraded just like any other Play Store application, according to your settings on your Android device. If you are using an ownCloud Android app from a custom repository, e.g., your employer, then it will update in accordance with their policies."

When upgrading from a release lower than 2.19, the app is using Scoped Storage instead of Shared Storage. The upgrade process takes care of transferring all files one by one from Shared Storage to Scoped Storage and deleting them from Shared Storage after a successful move of each file. Do not power off you device while an upgrade runs the migration process from Shared Storage to Scoped Storage. When finished, set up all connections once more, which are then automatically using Scoped Storage."
