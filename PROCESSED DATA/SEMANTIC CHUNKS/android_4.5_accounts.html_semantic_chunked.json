This will display a confirmation dialog, asking if you want to remove the account. If you click\nYes\n, the account will be removed. This action also logs you out of the server and deletes the database with the list of files. However, any files downloaded onto the device prior to removal will still be there afterwards. When removing an account, the files related to that account are removed automatically. This is also true when uninstalling the app which removes all accounts with their data."
