Mode Switcher\nDepending on your preferences or light conditions you can switch between\ndark mode\nand\nlight mode\n. If you upload or create a file with a name beginning with a period, you won’t see it, but it will be counted. A click on the three vertical dots opens an actions menu. Actions can be performed on a file or folder depending on the file type (video, text, etc.) The file size values differ depending on the client you are using. Some operating systems like iOS and macOS use the decimal system (power of 10) where 1kB or one kilobyte consists of 1000 bytes, while Linux, Android and Windows use the binary system (power of 2) where 1KB consists of 1024 bytes and is called a kibibyte. Versions\nIf you modified a document stored in Infinite Scale, you can always restore older versions. When collaborating with other people on the same documents, versioning is very important. If you share a document with an editor, you want to be able to check what happened with the document. Editor\nmodify documents,\ndelete documents. A downgrade to viewer or editor is possible. If available, you will see a question mark as shown in the image below:\nWhen clicking on the question mark, a context specific frame providing a help text will show up and can be closed by clicking outside the frame."

Left Sidebar\nPersonal\nUnder\nPersonal\nin the left sidebar you have your private place where you can upload files and folders or create them directly on Infinite Scale. But of course you want to be able to access them. You can also share files either via public link or internally with other users on the same Infinite Scale instance by invitation. Either way, you can grant permission to access files as\nViewer or Editor\n. Shares\nUnder\nShares\n, you can see all files or folders that have been shared with you. You can accept the share or decline. You can see who the owner of the share is and who else it has been shared with. Then there’s the time or date when the content has been shared. and on the permissions granted by the sharer. If members leave, sharing is not interrupted and sharees can keep working. When only content is shared, it is shown in the\nShared\narea, making it easier to distinguish the way of sharing, as well as viewing and assigning sharing roles and permissions. This increases security a lot and prevents accidentally providing private data to the outside world. In addition, when leaving the company or organization, sharing stays untouched and private data can safely be deleted. This area is intended for collaboration, like when sharing on a larger scale, working together on a project, in a department or in a school class. Right Sidebar\nThe right sidebar can be opened via the square icon with the dark or gray sidebar under your avatar symbol in the upper right corner:\nHere you find details about selected files: name, size, last modification time and with whom they have been shared. From here you can also use the\nActions\nmenu and reach the\nShare\nsection. Sharing is either done via the icons to the right of a file or folder or via the\nActions\nmenu or by opening the right sidebar and clicking\nShares\n. In any case, the right sidebar provides you a dialog where you can choose between inviting people registered on the Infinite Scale instance by entering their names or email addresses in the\nInvite\nfield and click\nShare\nor by sharing via link. A quick-action link also works for external people not registered on the Infinite Scale server. Below the\nShare with people\nsection, provide a name for the link and set an\nExpiration date\nand a password before hitting\nShare\n. For security reasons, the only possible role for unregistered users is\nviewer\n. The following table describes the default roles and their permissions. With the exception of the \"Uploader\" role, permissions\nsum up\nwith increasing responsibility. Contributor\ndownload documents,\nupload documents. (2) …​ When creating a \"Quicklink\" with the role\nInternal\nassigned, recipients of those links can quickly access a resource they already have access to. To access a Quicklink, the user must have an account and a grant to that resource with one of the other roles available. If the link recipient has no account and has not been granted access to the shared resource, accessing the linked content is not possible and nothing will be shown. See the image below for an example."

The origin of the share always resides in a space as you’ll see below. Spaces\nSpaces are the foundation for sharing data. Spaces are not owned by someone. Spaces store data and are designed for collaboration. Spaces first need to be created by a user having the\nCreate Space\npermission, see the\nCreating a Space\ndocumentation for details. The\nManager role\nfor managing the space can be delegated to one or more users, and the creator can remove himself or herself from this role completely. Spaces are organized by the space members themselves without intervention from admins. This is true not only for the whole space or for single files or directories, but also for roles and permissions assigned. A space either shows up as\nPersonal\nspace or in the\nSpaces\narea. Space Areas\nPersonal\nEvery user has a private space, where they can store or share content. This space is created automatically when the user is set up. Delegating the managing role or adding members to the personal space is not possible, but sharing single files or directories is enabled. With the inability to assign or delegate the managing role or add space members, the personal space stays in total control of the user. Consider using the personal space for data that is only relevant to you and shouldn’t be shared. For anything else better create one or more additional spaces for data you want to share. Spaces\nSpaces of which a user is member show up here. Sharing Roles and Permissions\nMembers can be added to a space so that they gain access to all files and folders within the space. Members are granted sharing\nand\nspace permissions, depending on their role. Members can have different roles and permissions in different spaces. When sharing single files and folders only, sharees are granted the sharing,\nbut not\nthe space permissions. Role\nSharing Permissions\nSpace Permissions\nUploader\nupload documents\n(existing content is not revealed)\nViewer\nread documents\n(includes viewing images or playing videos)\nget info about the space.

To regain full access including sharing and syncing, a deactivated space can be activated again. This makes it easier to reference content in big spaces, therefore the name Internal."
