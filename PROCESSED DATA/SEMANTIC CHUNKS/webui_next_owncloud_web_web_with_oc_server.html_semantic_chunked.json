Improved Accessibility\nWe have added new accessibility features to the ownCloud user interface. In addition to these new features, we also optimized a few other features in the frontend design of ownCloud. Features are still being added to ownCloud Web and users might need to use the regular web interface for certain tasks. Integrate Traditional ownCloud 10 Features in ownCloud Web\nownCloud features that are not deeply integrated in the regular web interface can be added to the app switcher and to the user menu. To add new elements, open the\nconfig.json\nfile in an editor, go to the\napplications\nsection and add entries like the following example:\n{\n\"title\": {\n\"en\": \"Custom Groups\",\n\"de\": \"Benutzerdefinierte Gruppen\"\n},\n\"icon\": \"settings-4\",\n\"url\": \"https://<your-owncloud-server>/settings/personal?sectionid=customgroups\"\n}\nThis method can also be used to link external sites like help pages. It fully integrates the ONLYOFFICE document editors and allows users to create and open documents directly in ownCloud Web. Collabora Online Integration\nThere is a native Collabora Online integration available for ownCloud Web when it is used with an ownCloud Server. It fully integrates the Collabora Online document editors and allows users to create and open documents directly in ownCloud Web.

The new global search is prepared for searching not only for files, but also for content in other apps like chat messages. In addition, the filetype icons are color-coded for example, PDF files are red, spreadsheets are green and zip archives are yellow. This allows users to perform typical actions even faster, for example, downloading documents or opening documents in the Collabora and OnlyOffice office apps. Easier Document Sharing\nThe new Web UI makes sharing content easier. It’s just as easy to invite users as viewers or editors to view or collaborate on documents. The new Web UI can be controlled completely via keyboard, offers improved color contrast for better readability, and supports navigation and operation via screen reader. We are thus meeting the requirements of many users in the public sector, such as educational and government institutions. These include, among others, the rounded windows and the “shimmer effect” while the data of a directory is loaded from the server. Download it from the\nMarketplace\nand run the command:\nsudo -u www-data ./occ market:install web\nAlternatively, log in to the server as admin and install the Web app via the Marketplace app. By default, the regular web interface will be used. If you do, the integrity check of the app will fail and issue warnings. There are plans to change the configuration of apps to give you a coherent admin experience in that regard."

On the far right of the top bar is the redesigned account menu, which now also shows the amount of storage space still available (personal quota). Collapsible Left Sidebar and New Icons\nThe application-specific navigation is located in the left sidebar as before. The sidebar has been made collapsible by request of many users, so that the area of the application main window can be maximized. For all icons in the sidebar and the main window, we use a new unified design set. Context Menu Accessible via Right-Click\nThe context menu with the most important app functions can now be opened via right click, a usability feature welcomed by many test users. Quick Action icons enable you to open files and folders with a single click. All those links will open in a new browser tab on click. Apps and links will be opened in a new browser tab. Entries for the user menu look like this:\n{\n\"icon\": \"settings-4\",\n\"menu\": \"user\",\n\"target\": \"_self\",\n\"title\": {\n\"de\": \"Hilfe\",\n\"en\": \"Help\"\n},\n\"url\": \"https://help-link.example\"\n}\nThis will add a link to the specified URL in the user menu. The link will open in the same tab. If you want it to open in a new tab, remove the line \"target\": \"_self\",."

On the right side, you can now turn on the new dark mode for ownCloud – an option that many users asked for. Deploying ownCloud Web\nownCloud Web can be deployed as an app. Configure Authentication\nownCloud Web works with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. If you’re using OpenID Connect, add ownCloud Web as a new client to your identity provider. If you prefer to use\nOAuth2\n, log in as admin, go to the\nUser Authentication\nsettings, add ownCloud Web as a new client and provide the redirect URL:\nhttps://<your-owncloud-server>/index.php/apps/web/oidc-callback.html\n. Server Configuration\nA few configuration steps are necessary on the ownCloud 10 server:\nSet the ownCloud Web address so it gets displayed in the app switcher by adding the following line to the\nconfig/config.php\nfile:\n'web.baseUrl' => 'https://<your-owncloud-server>/index.php/apps/web',\nConfigure link routing. Public and private links can either be provided by the regular web interface (default) or by the new ownCloud Web app. If you set the\nweb.rewriteLinks\noption in\nconfig/config.php\nto\ntrue\n, all links will be redirected to the new ownCloud Web:\n'web.rewriteLinks' => true,\nOptionally make ownCloud Web the default interface users see after they log in to ownCloud. To make ownCloud Web the default, add the following line to the\nconfig/config.php\nfile:\n'defaultapp' => 'web',\nWhile it is possible to make ownCloud Web the default interface, the decision should be carefully evaluated. Configuring ownCloud Web\nThere are a few configuration settings necessary for ownCloud Web to work correctly. Copy the example config below into the\nconfig/config.json\nfile (create one if it does not exist) and adjust it for your environment:\n{\n\"server\" : \"https://<your-owncloud-server>\",\n\"theme\": \"https://<your-owncloud-server>/themes/owncloud/theme.json\",\n\"auth\": {\n\"clientId\": \"<client-id-from-oauth2>\",\n\"url\": \"https://<your-owncloud-server>/index.php/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token\",\n\"authUrl\": \"https://<your-owncloud-server>/index.php/apps/oauth2/authorize\"\n},\n\"apps\" : [\n\"files\",\n\"preview\",\n\"draw-io\"\n],\n\"applications\" : [\n{\n\"title\": {\n\"en\": \"Classic Design\",\n\"de\": \"Klassisches Design\",\n\"fr\": \"Design classique\",\n\"zh_CN\": \"文件\"\n},\n\"icon\": \"swap-box\",\n\"url\": \"https://<your-owncloud-server>/index.php/apps/files\"\n},\n{\n\"icon\": \"settings-4\",\n\"menu\": \"user\",\n\"target\": \"_self\",\n\"title\": {\n\"de\": \"Einstellungen\",\n\"en\": \"Settings\"\n},\n\"url\": \"https://<your-owncloud-server>/index.php/settings/personal\"\n}\n]\n}\nIf you use OpenID Connect instead of OAuth2, you need to replace the \"auth\" part with the following configuration:\n\"openIdConnect\": {\n\"metadata_url\": \"<fqdn-of-the-identity-provider>/.well-known/openid-configuration\",\n\"authority\": \"<fqdn-of-the-identity-provider>\",\n\"client_id\": \"<client-id-from-the-identity-provider>\",\n\"response_type\": \"code\",\n\"scope\": \"openid profile email\"\n}\nIf any issues arise when trying to access the new design, a good start for debugging is to let a json validator check your\nconfig.json\nfile.

ONLYOFFICE Integration\nFor ONLYOFFICE there is a\nnative integration\navailable for ownCloud Web when it is used with an ownCloud Server. To use ONLYOFFICE in ownCloud Web, you need:\nownCloud Server >= 10.8\nownCloud Web >= 4.0.0\nONLYOFFICE connector\n>= 7.1.1\nMake sure that ONLYOFFICE works as expected in the regular UI then add the following to the\nconfig.json\nfile to make it available in ownCloud Web:\n\"external_apps\": [\n{\n\"id\": \"onlyoffice\",\n\"path\": \"https://<your-owncloud-server>/apps/onlyoffice/js/web/onlyoffice.js\"\n}\n]\nAdjust the URL in the example according to your setup. Requirements:\nownCloud server >= 10.8\nownCloud Web >= 4.0.0\nCollabora Online\napp >= 2.7.0\nMake sure that Collabora Online works as expected in the regular UI, then add the following to\nconfig.json\nto make it available in ownCloud Web:\n\"external_apps\": [\n{\n\"id\": \"richdocuments\",\n\"path\": \"https://<your-owncloud-server>/apps/richdocuments/js/richdocuments.js\"\n}\n]\nAdjust the URL to match your setup. Configuring the Preview App\nIn case there are additional preview providers configured in the backend, there is no mechanism to announce those to the Preview app in ownCloud Web. Accessing ownCloud Web\nAfter following all the steps, you should see a new entry in the application switcher called\nNew Design\nwhich takes you to ownCloud Web."

The Preview app needs to be moved from the apps section to the external_apps section because only external apps support additional configuration."
