So no reason to worry if you see different file sizes in ownCloud Web and on your mobile device. Sharing Files\nYou can share with other ownCloud users and groups, and create public or private share links. Multiple public links per/file is only available with ownCloud X. From here you can:\nShare one link to the file with users of the same ownCloud server\nShare the file with one or more users and groups\nShare one or more links to the file via a range of options\nEnable password protection\nSet a share expiration date\nTo create a private link, click the\nlink\nicon on the right of the file name. Private link is available from ownCloud X. If your ownCloud server administrator has enabled username auto-completion, when you start typing user or group names they will auto-complete. You don’t have to guess; the Personal page in the ownCloud Web GUI tells the exact Federated Cloud ID. Creating New Content\nTo add new content to your ownCloud server, whether files, folders, or content from other apps, click the blue button at the bottom right to expose the\nUpload\nand\nNew folder\nbuttons. Then, use the\nUpload\nbutton to add files to your ownCloud account from your Android filesystem, from other apps, or from every storage attached to your device\nClick the\noverflow button\nat the top right (that’s the one with three vertical dots) to open a user menu. From there, under\nUpload to ownCloud\n, click\nPicture from camera\n. The camera app will then start, and the picture that you take can be directly uploaded to your ownCloud server.

Download and view a file with a short press on the file’s name or icon. Then, a short press on the overflow button opens a menu with options for managing your file. When you are on your main Files page and you long press on any file or folder a list of options appears, which you can see in the image below. Some of them appear in the top bar. The ones that don’t fit in the top bar, appear in the list of options when pressing the overflow button. After the options have been suitably configured, click\nSave\nto create the link.

Upload Pictures Directly From The Camera\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nImages can be uploaded directly from the camera. To do so, similar to uploading a file or creating a new folder, when viewing all files, click the\nPlus\nicon, then the\nUpload\nbutton in the popup list (which is the first icon). To select multiple files, long select the first file that you want to work with; you will see a checkbox appear on the far right-hand side. After that, check the checkbox next to all the other files that you want to perform the same operation on, and then perform the operation. Uploading Files Taken From the Camera\nPictures and videos can be uploaded from your smartphone after choosing the folder where they are stored. To specify where they are located, in the\n\"Settings\"\noptions, under\nCamera uploads\n, enable one of\n\"Picture uploads\"\nor\n\"Video uploads\"\n. After that, a further option called\n\"Camera folder\"\nwill become visible, as in the screenshot below. Multiple folders:\nWhen multiple folders are selected, click the\ndown arrow\nicon near the top of the screen."

Some operating systems like iOS and macOS use the decimal system (power of 10) where 1kB or one kilobyte consists of 1000 bytes, while Linux, Android and Windows use the binary system (power of 2) where 1KB consists of 1024 bytes and is called a kibibyte. Working With Multiple Files\nThe Android application can perform some operations on multiple files simultaneously, such as refreshing and deleting. Make Folders Available Offline\nFolders can be made available for when no internet or mobile connectivity is available. Doing so caches a copy of the folder and its contents locally to the device (assuming that sufficient disc space is available). Depending on the number of folders selected for offline availability, how folders are made available offline works slightly differently. A single folder:\nWhen a single folder is selected, click the\nMore options\nmenu, which opens a popup menu, and then select the first option, labeled:\n\"Set as available offline\"\n. When the folders have been cached locally, the icon will change to be a purple circle with a white tick icon in the bottom right-hand corner, as in the screenshot below."

Current Uploads\nThe Uploads page displays the status of files currently uploading, a list of your recently uploaded files, and a Retry option for any failed uploads. If credentials to access the file have changed, you’ll see a credentials error. Tap the file to retry, and you’ll get a login screen to enter the new credentials. If the upload fails because you’re trying to upload to a folder that you do not have permission to access, you will see a\n\"Permissions error\"\n. Change the permissions on the folder and retry the upload, or cancel and then upload the file to a different folder."
