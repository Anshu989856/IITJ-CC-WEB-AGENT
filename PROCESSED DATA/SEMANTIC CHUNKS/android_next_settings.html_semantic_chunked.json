Camera Uploads\nIf you take photos or create videos with your Android device, they can be automatically uploaded to your ownCloud server. Allow Light Filtering Apps\nBy enabling the option (which you can see in the screenshot below), the ownCloud Android App will not be obscured by any light filtering apps, which gives the choice of using them together. Logs\nIf you detect a problem or a bug in the ownCloud Android App, you can send us logs about the problem. To enable the logs, you have to\ntap five times on the version and build information\n, available under\nSettings\nownCloud for Android\n. When enabled, inside the log section of the Android ownCloud app, options to share and delete logs are available. ownCloud does not provide a built-in log reader anymore as there are many professional apps available. And, if you want extra security, you can set a login PIN on your Android device, and also on your ownCloud account. If you are using a shared Android device, other users can access your files in the file manager if you are sharing a single user account. After you enable the pattern lock, you will need to create a pattern and then confirm it to access the ownCloud app, just as you would if you’ve enabled that for access to the phone itself. If you enable the fingerprint lock, you will need to provide one of your already stored fingerprint patterns to access the ownCloud app. Managing Your Files\nDocument Provider Integration\nAbout ownCloud\nThe Secure Collaboration Platform\nNews\nPrivacy statement\nImprint\nResources\nFAQ\nHelp\nSecurity\nChangelog\nGet started\nInteract\nRocket.Chat\nForum\nContribute\nCustomer support\n© Copyright 2011-2025, The ownCloud developers."

The same settings are available on a separate screen for video uploads. By enabling these features, any new photos or videos which you create will be automatically uploaded every 15 minutes. Photos and videos are not uploaded when they’re created, to focus on reliability, instead of immediacy, and to avoid battery draining caused by excessive checking of the camera folder. Be aware that if you used the earlier\nInstant Uploads\nfeature, you will lose the configuration and have to enable the \"Camera uploads\" feature if you want to use it, since it needs to be initialized and configured properly. If you’re concerned about mobile data usage or have an account with limited data available, you can limit uploading to only when a WiFi is in use. For photos tap\nUpload pictures via wifi only\nFor videos tap\nUpload videos via wifi only\nIn addition, you can select to upload only when charging the device to avoid battery drain. All selected uploading conditions must be met for uploads to happen. By default, photos and videos are uploaded to a directory called\n/CameraUpload\n.
