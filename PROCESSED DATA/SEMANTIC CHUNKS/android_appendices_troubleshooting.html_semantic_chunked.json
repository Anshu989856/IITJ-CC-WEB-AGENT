To assist the ownCloud support personnel, please try to provide as many relevant logs as possible. You can ship this information via mail (\nandroid-app@owncloud.com\n), creating a new issue in the\nopen GitHub ownCloud Android repository\n, or in\npublic ownCloud forum\n. This log file must be enabled through the ownCloud Administration page. You can view the server log file using the web interface or you can open it directly from the file system in the ownCloud server data directory. Please see the\nownCloud server logging\npages to read more. Webserver Log Files\nIt can be helpful to view your webserver’s error log file to isolate any ownCloud-related problems. The ownCloud Android app sends the\nX-REQUEST-ID\nheader with every request. You’ll find the\nX-REQUEST-ID\nin the\nowncloud.log\n, and you can configure your webserver to add the\nX-REQUEST-ID\nto the logs.

Log output can help with tracking down problems and, if you report a bug, log output can help to resolve an issue more quickly. Logs may contain sensitive information. Sharing logs with others is sole user responsibility. When you have reproduced the issue you want to address, the \"Send History\" button will automatically add the logs to a new mail message. To get it:\nDelete History\nPerform the steps to reproduce the error\nGo back to the settings and select Logs\nIn the three-dot-button (top right corner), select Logcat\nSend History\nDeleting the history before getting logs is a good practice that will help the team to debug the problem, avoiding unnecessary noise. On that page, you can adjust the log level. We recommend that when setting the log file level that you set it to a verbose level like\nDebug\nor\nInfo\n. Some helpful files include the following:\nerror_log\n— Maintains errors associated with PHP code."
