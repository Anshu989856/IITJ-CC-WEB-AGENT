This page gives you a brief overview of limitations regarding file and folder names on different operating systems. When the source file is on an environment that allows the path component of the path/filename length exceeding 260 characters, the file will not be syncable to a Windows standard client without additional measures. Maximum Path Length Limitation\nThough each file system has its limits as described in\nWikipedia: Comparison of file systems\n, you normally will rarely reach them. Here, with the default Windows setting, the\npath component\nfor a file created via API is\nlimited\nto 260 characters - which can be reached quickly. When using the Desktop App for Windows with VFS configured, files may not be able to be synced if the source file was created in an environment where the path component exceeded the 260 character limit. Fix for Windows\nTo overcome the maximum path length limitation of 260 characters, Microsoft has provided a\nsolution document\nwhere they describe the opt-in process to relax the path length limitation when using API calls, like VFS does when creating files and folders."
