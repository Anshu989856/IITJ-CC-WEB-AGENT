The green circle with the white checkmark tells you that your synchronization is current and you are connected to your ownCloud server. The gray icon with three white dots means your Desktop App has lost its connection with your ownCloud server. File Manager Overlay Icons\nThe ownCloud Desktop App provides overlay icons, if not using the VFS feature, in addition to the normal file type icons, for your system file manager (Explorer on Windows, Finder on Mac and Nautilus on Linux) to indicate the sync status of your ownCloud files. First you need to enter the URL of your ownCloud instance:\nNote that the URL given to you can be a different one than the final URL used by the Desktop app. Enter your ownCloud login on the next screen. Note that with OAuth 2.0 and with OpenID Connect (OIDC), you will be redirected to a browser for authentication:\nTo use\nTwo-Factor Authentication\n(2FA) with the ownCloud Server backend, ownCloud Server must have the\nOAuth2 app\ninstalled, configured and enabled. Please contact your ownCloud administrator for more details. Login with ownCloud embedded user database\nLogin with OAuth 2.0 or OIDC\n(Follow the web login process)\nAdvanced Configuration:\nWhen enabling\nAdvanced configuration\n, you can refine your synchronization configuration if desired. The Desktop app will attempt to connect to your ownCloud server and will start synchronizing your files. Adding New Accounts\nYou may configure multiple ownCloud accounts in your Desktop app. Selecting one account, you have the following features available:\nConnection status, showing which ownCloud server you are connected to, and your ownCloud username. The little button with three dots (the overflow menu) that sits to the right of the sync status bar offers four additional options:\nShow in Explorer\nOpens your local ownCloud sync folder. Show in web browser\nOpens your ownCloud via the browser. In most cases, they are similar to folders or external mounts when the backend is ownCloud Server and one might not see differences, though some exist:\nOn initial account setup, all available spaces are auto-selected for the synchronization process. If you have used ownCloud Infinite Scale with a Desktop app version older then 3.0, you must remove the account from the Desktop app and do an initial account setup again to work with spaces. Depending on the backend connected, resources shown can be the full external mount or a folder inside an external mount when using ownCloud Server, or spaces when using Infinite Scale. Using an Account That Connects To ownCloud Server:\nWhen VFS has been enabled on initial account setup, all new resources from the server will be added automatically but do not require additional space. Finalize with\nAdd Sync Connection\n:\nSharing From Your Desktop\nThe ownCloud Desktop App integrates with your file manager:\nExplorer on Windows,\nFinder on macOS,\nand Nautilus on Linux. (Linux users must install the\nowncloud-client-nautilus\nplugin.) You can share with internal ownCloud users and groups and create links to share with external users. If you are not already at the location of the file or folder to share, right-click your systray icon, hover over the account you want to use, and left-click\nOpen folder\n\"folder name\"\nto quickly enter your local ownCloud folder. Go to the file or folder you want to share. Right-click the file or folder you want to share to expose the share dialog which opens the context menu, and click\nownCloud\nShare\n. Depending on the backend used, different things can happen:\nownCloud Infinite Scale\nThe default browser opens and shows the share dialog of ownCloud Web to take the required settings. ownCloud Server\nThe share dialog opens which has all the same options as your ownCloud Server Web interface. Sharing with users and groups\nPublic sharing\nUse\nownCloud\nShare\nfrom the context menu to see who you have shared with and to modify their permissions or to delete the share. Server Notifications\nThe desktop client will display notifications from your ownCloud server that require manual interaction. For example, when a user on a remote ownCloud creates a new Federated share for you, you can accept it from your desktop client. This also displays notifications sent to users by the ownCloud admin via the Announcements app. (typically\nsync-exclude.lst\n) located in the ownCloud Desktop app directory.

            "chunk_content": "Icons\nUsed App Icons\nThe status indicator uses icons to indicate the current status of your synchronization. The blue icon with the white semi-circles means synchronization is in progress. (Most likely by you.) When you see a white circle with the letter \"i\" that is the informational icon, so you should click it to see what it has to tell you. The red circle with the white \"x\" indicates a configuration error, such as an incorrect login or server URL. The overlay icons are similar to the systray icons introduced above. If the file is in sync with the server version, it displays a green checkmark. This can be the case if a company has a generic setup URL that provides the Desktop app information about where to connect you. This mechanism is called\nWebFinger\nand has the big benefit that one only needs to know the generic setup URL. The Desktop app tries to identify if webfinger is provided via the given URL and acts accordingly based on the server’s response. This all runs in the background but is explained here in case you see a different URL being used than entered. Used and available space on the server. This appears only when your file tree is collapsed, and expands the file tree. Spaces\nSpaces are only available when connected to an Infinite Scale backend. There are at minimum two spaces added, which are the personal space and the space that contains all received shares. Shares are shown as folders in the local filesystem. Spaces can be customized with images in the Web UI. The image selected is also shown in the Desktop app. When a space gets disabled or deleted via the Web UI, no data is deleted locally. These resources are represented by the Desktop app as local folders using the base path defined during account setup. You will see a list of available remote resources you can manage as shown in the screenshot below. If a new resource gets added on the server like via the Web UI, it will be listed here. It also shows the state of the synchronization process:\nWhen a new space gets added via the Web UI, it will not be automatically listed here as this window only shows spaces that are already synchronized. Activity Window\nThe Activity window contains the log of your recent activities, organized over three tabs:\nServer Activities\nIncludes new shares and files downloaded and deleted. On Linux, you can do the same with\nmouse\nright-click\nShow file in browser\nIn any of the activity tabs you can mark a single line, multiple lines or all lines with\nCTRL\n+\na\nand copy the selected lines to the clipboard with\nmouse\nright-click\nCopy to clipboard\n. It automatically checks for available notifications automatically on a regular basis. Notifications are displayed in the Server Activity tab. If you have enabled\nSettings\nGeneral Settings\nShow Desktop Notifications\nyou’ll also see a systray notification. The available bandwidth is measured on the fly at the beginning of every operation for a very short period of time. As an example, you can use an asterisk (\n*\n) to identify an arbitrary number of characters or a question mark (\n?\n) to identify a single character."

            "chunk_content": "The yellow icon with the parallel lines tells you your synchronization has been paused. They behave differently on files and directories according to sync status and errors. The overlay icon of an individual file indicates its current sync state. If the file is ignored while syncing, for example because it is on your exclude list or because it is a symbolic link, it displays a warning icon. If there is a sync error, or the file is blacklisted, it displays an eye-catching red X. If the file is waiting to be synced, or is currently being synced, the overlay icon displays a blue cycling icon. When the Desktop App is offline, no icons are shown to reflect that the folder is currently out of sync and no changes are synced to the server. The overlay icon of a synced directory indicates the status of the files in the directory. If there are any sync errors, the directory is marked with a warning icon. Here you can define the synchronization method like using the\nVirtual Filesystem\nor the location for synchronized data. Here you can define network settings, bandwidth limitations, a confirmation setting to limit folder synchronization size and more. Add Folder Sync Connection\nbutton. Choose What to Sync\nSelect the folders and mounts in the main window to be synced. Force sync now / Restart sync\nStart the sync process immediately - if none is running, or restart a running sync process. Pause Sync\nPauses sync operations without making any changes to your account. It will continue to update file and folder lists, without downloading or updating files. Remove Folder Sync Connection\nStop all sync activity. Force Syncing a Folder\nIf there is data to be synced immediately, like when you are on the road and need to continue working offline, you can force syncing a folder of an account before the network connection goes offline. To do so, select the account and then the folder to force sync and the\nThree Dots\nForce sync now\nbutton. When a space is renamed in the Web UI, it also gets renamed in the sync window view, but the local folder name where it is stored does not change. This includes the syncronization type which defaults to VFS if available on your operating system (OS) or selective sync where you manually select the resoures to be synchronized otherwise. If VFS is available for your OS but selective sync has been chosen, you can at any time switch to VFS and vice versa. Note to check the available disk space before switching from VFS to selective sync (Disable Virtual File support). The base path defined on first sync is not the only path that can be used. In case selective sync has been chosen, different options are available to add resources. To add a resource to be synced as folder to the\nsame base path\n, set the check mark. To remove a resource from syncing, deselect it. To add a resource to be synced as folder to a\ndifferent path\nthan the account base path, click in the bottom left corner on\nAdd Folder\n. Select the path and the resources to sync and complete the process. Using an Account That Connects To Infinite Scale:\nWhen an account connects to Infinite Scale, the list of currently synced spaces looks like the image below. To add a new space for synchronization, click the\nAdd Space\nbutton, select the space and define the path if you do not want to take the default base location. Sync Protocol\nDisplays local activities such as which local folders your files went into. Not Synced\nShows errors such as files not synced because of being excluded or any other failing status. In Windows, double-clicking an activity entry pointing to an existing file in tabs\nServer Activities\nor\nSync Protocol\n, will open the folder containing the file and highlight it. Settings Window\nThe Settings Window has configuration options such as:\nGeneral Settings\nLaunch on System Startup\nShow Desktop Notifications\nUse Monochrome Icons\nAdvanced\nShow sync folders in Explorer’s Navigation Pane\nSync hidden files\nHidden files are files starting with a dot like\n.filename.txt\n, but not files which are hidden by setting a file attribute. Show crash reporter and the\nButtons for\nEdit Ignored Files\n(\nsee below\n) and\nLog settings\nAdvanced - Approval Synchronizing Folders\nThis is only valid if not using the\nVFS\nfeature. Ask confirmation before downloading folders larger than [folder size]\nAsk for confirmation before synchronizing external storages\nWhile you can select whether to show or hide the crash reporter, from the Settings Window, you can also configure whether to show or hide it from the\ngeneral section of the configuration file\nas well. If your synchronization does not work as you expected, check your syntax. Files are removed that cause individual errors three times during a synchronization. However, the client provides the option of retrying a synchronization three additional times on files that produce errors. Removing a Sync Connection\nWhen removing a synchronization connection, all synchronized data will stay locally and not get deleted. To remove a sync relationship, change to the account and select the synchronization relationship that should get removed. When clicking the\n…​\n(three dots) icon, the following window appears:\nSelect\nRemove folder sync connection\nto remove it. If you also want to delete the related data, go to the folder and delete it. This will open the source folder where all the synced data is located. This eases deleting this folder as you do not need to search for it after removing the sync connection."

Resources can have their individual base path. This is can be beneficial if you want selected resources to be located on different paths than the default. Using the Ignored Files Editor\nYou might have some local files or directories that you do not want to backup and store on the server. To identify and exclude these files or directories, you can use the\nSettings\nAdvanced\nIgnored Files Editor\n. Note that rules for ignored files are also applied to folders. For your convenience, the editor is pre-populated with a default list of typical ignore patterns. These patterns are contained in a system file. You cannot modify these pre-populated patterns directly from the editor. However, if necessary, you can hover over any pattern in the list to show the path and filename associated with that pattern, locate the file, and edit the\nsync-exclude.lst\nfile. Modifying the global exclude definition file might render the client unusable or result in undesired behavior. Each line in the editor contains an ignore pattern string. When creating custom patterns, in addition to being able to use normal characters to define an ignore pattern, you can use wildcards characters for matching values. Patterns that end with a slash character (\n/\n) are applied to only directory components of the path being checked. Custom entries are currently not validated for syntactical correctness by the editor, so you will not see any warnings for bad syntax. Each pattern string in the list is preceded by a checkbox. When the checkbox contains a check mark, in addition to ignoring the file or directory component matched by the pattern, any matched files are also deemed \"fleeting metadata\" and removed by the client. In addition to excluding files and directories that use patterns defined in this list:\nThe ownCloud Client always excludes files containing characters that cannot be synchronized to other file systems.
