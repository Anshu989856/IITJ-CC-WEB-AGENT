For this purpose, we created the\nownCloud Generator for Admins\nwith which you can generate a customized Microsoft Teams app for your users accessing your ownCloud services. Each ownCloud domain to be accessed requires a separate generated Microsoft Teams app for your users. Prerequisites\nTo get this working, you need to install and/or configure the following components:\nOption 1 \"Enterprise\": With Single Sign-On (SSO) and ownCloud Enterprise Edition\nMicrosoft Azure Active Directory\nownCloud apps:\nOpenID Connect\nMS-Teams Bridge App\nThe custom app(s) you have generated with\nownCloud Generator for Admins\nMicrosoft Teams\nOption 2 \"Standard\": With Basic Authentication and ownCloud Standard Edition\nownCloud apps:\nOpenID Connect\nThe custom Microsoft Teams app(s) you have generated with the\nownCloud Generator for Admins\nMicrosoft Teams\nNote: If you are using the Standard Edition, you can skip the following steps that describe the configuration of Azure AD and the MS-Teams Bridge App. ownCloud\nInstallation\nAssuming you have an ownCloud server version 10.7 or higher already running in your company or for personal use, perform the following steps:\nInstall and enable the MS-Teams Bridge app, minimum required version: v1.0.0. Configure the MS-Teams Bridge App\nYou need to configure the MS-Teams Bridge app in two steps:\nAdd a\nheader\ndirective to the Apache\n.htaccess\nconfiguration located in your ownCloud web root in section\n<IfModule mod_env.c>\nHeader merge Content-Security-Policy \"frame-ancestors 'self' teams.microsoft.com *.teams.microsoft.com\"\nHeader edit* Content-Security-Policy , ;\nUsing\nmerge\n, the response header is appended to any existing header of the same name, unless the value to be appended already appears in the header’s comma-delimited list of values. Users will be asked to click a login button each time when accessing the ownCloud app after a fresh start of their Microsoft Teams app or after idle time. 'msteamsbridge' => [\n\"loginButtonName\" => \"Login to ownCloud with Azure AD\",\n],\nEnable\nindex.php less URL´s\non your web server. Create Your Microsoft Teams App\nThe following procedure creates an ownCloud app ready to be used by your users with Microsoft Teams in your environment. We recommend naming it\nownCloud for Teams\nfor easy identification. Enter the URL how you access your owncloud instance like\nhttps://cloud.example.com\n. Go to the app section of Microsoft Teams and upload the generated zip file to your organization’s app catalogue. Manage your apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center\nManage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams\nSee the\nusers documentation\nabout their necessary steps how to integrate ownCloud into Microsoft Teams. Alternative ownCloud Website Tab\nAs an alternative to creating an app for Microsoft Teams, it’s also possible to embed ownCloud as a Microsoft Teams tab website. Tabs are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. See the\nWhat are Microsoft Teams tabs\ndocumentation to find out more. Add a meaningful name and the following URL replacing \"cloud.example.com\" with how you access your ownCloud instance. https://cloud.example.com/apps/msteamsbridge\nSupport\nIf you encounter problems with the integration of ownCloud and Teams, please contact ownCloud support or look for answers to those problems at the\nForum\nIntegration\nownCloud App for Splunk\nAbout ownCloud\nThe Secure Collaboration Platform\nNews\nPrivacy statement\nImprint\nResources\nFAQ\nHelp\nSecurity\nChangelog\nGet started\nInteract\nRocket.Chat\nForum\nContribute\nCustomer support\n© Copyright 2011-2025, The ownCloud developers."
