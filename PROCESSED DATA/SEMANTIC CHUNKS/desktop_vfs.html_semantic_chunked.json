This has the big advantage that all files and folders are visible to the Desktop App, but the files are not downloaded until the user requests to do so. Here are some of the key benefits:\nFull access to files and folders without having to download them all first\nSelectively sync folders and files based on user requirements\nOptimize space usage on the Desktop App\nThe quote below gives you a brief overview of what a virtual file system is about. A virtual file system (VFS) or virtual filesystem switch is an abstract layer on top of a more concrete file system. The purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access different types of concrete file systems in a uniform way. A VFS can, for example, be used to access local and network storage devices transparently without the client application noticing the difference. It can be used to bridge the differences in Windows, classic Mac OS/macOS and Unix filesystems, so that applications can access files on local file systems of those types without having to know what type of file system they are accessing. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system\nMicrosoft VFS Implementation\nBackground\nA sync engine is a service that syncs files, typically between a remote host and a local client. Sync engines on Windows often present those files to the user through the Windows file system and File Explorer."

Placeholder file\nAn empty representation of the file and only available if the sync service is available. Limitations and Restrictions\nLimitations\nA virtual file system needs a root folder all synchronization items will be stored in. The following locations are\nnot\nallowed as synchronization root:\nThe root of a disk like\nD:\\\nA non-NTFS Filesystem\nMounted network shares\nSymbolic links or junction points\nAssigned drives\nRestrictions\nSimilar to OneDrive as it also uses Microsoft’s virtual file system, there are some additional restrictions which should be considered like the\nmaximum file size\n,\ninvalid file or folder names\n, etc. ownCloud VFS Implementation\nNote that when using Windows and VFS, the Desktop app needs full control of the sync folder and its subsequent folders where the data gets stored. If this is not the case, access denied errors most likely will occur when syncing VFS data. New Sync with VFS enabled\nTo set up a new synchronization with virtual file system enabled, perform the following steps:\nAdd a new synchronization by clicking the\n+ Add account\nbutton. Select the radio button\nUse virtual files\nand set the local folder where your synchronization data will reside. After the first sync, your synchronization folder will show your items with the\nPlaceholder\nicon. Convert Full Sync to VFS\nIf you have full synchronization enabled, you can change to a virtual file system at any time. Open your existing synchronization, click the\n…​\nbutton and\nEnable virtual file support\n. Convert VFS to Full Sync\nYou can also change the synchronization setting from virtual file system to full sync. Open your existing synchronization, click the\n…​\nbutton and\nDisable virtual file support\n. The state of the file will change to synchronizing. Open a\nPowerShell\ncommand line window like via the start menu and change to the directory of the ownCloud sync folder/subfolder that contains the data you want to bulk change."

The following image demonstrates how the\nfull pinned\n,\nfull\nand\nplaceholder\nfile states are shown in File Explorer. When opening a file, the file gets downloaded and its synchronization icon changes to\nFull\n. Your local files will get replaced by\nplaceholders\n, thus freeing up the space previously occupied. When done, your files will be fully downloaded, which you can tell by the sync icons, see the example image below. Depending on the quantity and size of the files, this may take a while. This opens a drop-down menu of actions that can be performed on a specific file or folder. The following example shows this on files, but it can be applied on folders too. Create a Local Copy\nTo create a Full Pinned file (have a local copy of it), use the action\nAlways keep on this device\n. When the local copy has been created, the state (icon) changes to\nFull Pinned\n. Free up Space\nTo free up the space the file occupied, use the action\nFree up space\n. When done, Explorer will show the file in\nPlaceholder\nstate. This is done by turning files that were set to be\nlocally available\nback to cloud-based content, which are\nplaceholder files\non the local drive, requiring no space."
