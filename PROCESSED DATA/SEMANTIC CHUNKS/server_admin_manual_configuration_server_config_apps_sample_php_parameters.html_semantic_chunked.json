Keep\nin mind that you need to grant communication access at your Microsoft Office\nOnline instance with this ownCloud instance. For further information, read the\nownCloud documentation. Note that you will get a working URL from ownCloud Support after you provide a written\ndeclaration that your company has an eligible Microsoft Business contract. To use this option, you need at least ownCloudâ€™s Microsoft Office Online app version 1.6.0. Users will be asked to click a login\nbutton each time when accessing the ownCloud app after a fresh start of their\nMicrosoft Teams app or after idle time.

Both\nhidden files and folders will be shown, and you can write on read-only files\n(the action is available in ownCloud, but it will fail in the SMB server). However, due to\nproblems in recent libsmbclient versions (4.11+, it might be earlier) it will cause\nmalfunctions in ownCloud; permissions are wrongly evaluated. This option\nmakes the group membership component assume the ACL contains a user and checks whether\nthere is a user in ownCloud with such a name first. The data contained in each key is as follows:\nockeytab\n(required): The location of the keytab file that ownCloud\nwill use to access to the mounts using that server ID. usermapping\n(optional): The ownCloud-to-windows user mapping to be used. ccachettl\n(optional): The time (in seconds) that the credential cache\nwill be considered as valid from the ownCloudâ€™s side. The ownCloud user ID will be\nreturned without changes, so itâ€™s expected that the ownCloud user ID\nmatches the Windows / Samba user ID. RemoveDomain\n: Remove the domain (if any) from the ownCloud user ID. EALdapAttr\n: Use ownCloudâ€™s user extended attributes to map the ownCloud\nuser to the target LDAP attribute. nomap\n(optional): a list of uids not registered in ownCloud that\nwonâ€™t be mapped and be returned without any change. The following scenarios will cause errors:\nIf ownCloud canâ€™t map the user and he isnâ€™t in the\nnomap\nlist. If the user is registered in ownCloud and is in the\nnomap\nlist. By default, ownCloud usually normalizes names to NFC. Data will remain in the cache and wonâ€™t\nbe removed by ownCloud.

Depending on circumstances, you might want to add the\nerror code 1, which means an operation not permitted (although there could\nbe cases where this \"operation not permitted\" might not be caused by a wrong\npassword). Note that the ACLs (if active) will be evaluated and applied on top of this mechanism. Code Sample\n'wnd.fileInfo.parseAttrs.mode' => 'stat',\nMake the Group Membership Component Assume that the ACL Contains a User\nThe WND app doesnâ€™t know about the users or groups associated with ACLs. This\nmeans that an ACL containing \"admin\" might refer to a user called \"admin\" or a\ngroup called \"admin\". By default, the group membership component considers the ACLs to\ntarget groups, and as such, it will try to get the information for such a group. This\nworks fine if the majority of the ACLs target groups. If the majority of the ACLs\ncontain users, this might be problematic. If the name doesnâ€™t refer to a user,\nit will get the group information. It is\nrecommended to enable this option only if there are a high number of ACLs targeting users. Code Sample\n'wnd.groupmembership.checkUserFirst' => false,\nEnable or Disable the WND In-Memory Notifier for Password Changes\nHaving this feature enabled implies that whenever a WND process detects a\nwrong password in the storage - maybe the password has changed in the\nbackend - all WND storages that are in-memory will be notified in order to reset\ntheir passwords if applicable and not to requery again. The intention is to prevent a potential password lockout for the user in the backend. Code Sample\n'wnd.in_memory_notifier.enable' => true,\nA Map of Servers With the Required Kerberos Data\nA map of servers with the required data to get the Kerberos credentials\nin order to access them. Each key of the map must be unique and identifies a server. This ID will\nbe used in the web UI to configure the mount points to use the Kerberos\nauthentication. You can use any ID (choose one meaningful and easy to remember). The keytab must\nbe for a service account with special privileges, in particular, it must\nbe able to impersonate the users. It is highly recommended that the password\nfor this service account doesnâ€™t expire, otherwise you will have to replace\nthe file manually before the expiration. See the Kerberos documentation for details. ocservice\n(required): The name of the service of the account. This matches\nthe SPN of the Windows / Samba account. It usually is in the form \"HTTP/<hostname>\",\nbut it might be different. See the Kerberos documentation for details. If no user mapping is provided, the\nNoop\nmapping will\nbe used. Once the TTL is over, new credentials will be\nrequested automatically. This means that \"\nuser001@my.dom.com\n\" will map to \"user001\". Note that\nitâ€™s assumed that all users belong to the same domain, otherwise\n\"\nuser001@my.dom.com\n\" will be mapped to the same windows user as\n\"\nuser001@not.mine.eu\n\". The mapping has 2 parameters:\nattr\n: in order to select the LDAP attribute you want to use. Note\nthat itâ€™s required that the user_ldap app exposes the chosen attribute which\nrequires user_ldap 0.19.0+. If it isnâ€™t a LDAP user. Code Sample\n'wnd.kerberos.servers' => [\n'server_ID1' => [\n'ockeytab' => '<keytab-file-location>/<user-name>.keytab',\n'ocservice' => 'HTTP/<hostname_or_FQDN>',\n'usermapping' => ['type' => 'Noop'],\n'ccachettl' => 60 * 60 * 9,\n],\n'server_ID2' => [\n'ockeytab' => '<keytab-file-location>/<user-name>.keytab',\n'ocservice' => 'HTTP/<hostname_or_FQDN>',\n'usermapping' => ['type' => 'RemoveDomain'],\n'ccachettl' => 60 * 60 * 9,\n],\n'server_ID3' => [\n'ockeytab' => '<keytab-file-location>/<user-name>.keytab',\n'ocservice' => 'HTTP/<hostname_or_FQDN>',\n'usermapping' => [\n'type' => 'EALdapAttr',\n'params' => [\n'attr' => 'userPrincipalName',\n'nomap' => ['ocService@example.prv', 'secondaryAccount@company.com'],\n]\n],\n'cachettl' => 3600,\n],\n],\nListen to the Events Triggered by the smb_acl App\nThe current use is to update the WND storages (with \"login credentials,\nsaved in DB\" authentication) when an ACL changes via the smb_acl app\nCode Sample\n'wnd.listen_events.smb_acl' => false,\nMandatory Listener Reconnect to the Database\nThe listener will reconnect to the DB after given seconds."

Please consider\nthat this can have a performance impact when changes are sent to many users. Increase it if requests to the server sometimes time out. This can happen when SMB3\nencryption is selected and smbclient is overwhelming the server with requests. So far, this mode works\nwith libsmbclient 4.7 but not with 4.11+ (not tested with any version in between). The cost of getting information on a\ngroup is usually higher than getting information on a user. Note that this will have performance implications\nif the group membership component canâ€™t discard users in a large number of cases. As with PHP lower than 7.4, this feature can take a lot of memory resources. This is because WND keeps the storage access and its caches in-memory. With PHP 7.4 or above, the memory usage has been reduced significantly. This TTL MUST be\nlower than the actual TTL. The default TTL is 9 hours, which is less than\nthe 10 hours set by Windows by default. Real memory usage per item varies because it depends on the path being cached. Note that this is an in-memory cache used per request. Multiple mounts using the same permission manager will share the same\ncache, limiting the maximum memory that will be used. Code Sample\n'wnd.permissionmanager.cache.size' => 512,\nManage UTF-8 Glyph Normalization on macOS\nA glyph is a character like\nÃ±\nas used in the spanish word\nseÃ±orita\nwhich can be composed by two different byte sequences. With\nUTF-8\n, glyphs can have two valid representations of these sequences in filesystems. Normalization\nmakes it possible to determine whether any two Unicode strings are equivalent. The value will be used by all WND2 storages. Although the\ncache isnâ€™t exactly per user but per storage id, consider the cache to be per user, because\nit will be like that for common use cases. Aim for a low TTL value in order to not fill the memcache\ncompletely. In order to properly disable caching, use -1 or any negative value. 0 (zero)\nisnâ€™t considered a valid TTL value and will also disable caching."
