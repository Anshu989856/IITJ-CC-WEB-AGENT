You\nmay also allow users to mount their own external storage services. Starting with ownCloud 9.0, a new set of occ commands for\nmanaging external storage\nis introduced. This also includes an option for the ownCloud admin to enable or disable sharing on individual\nexternal mountpoints\n. See external_storage/auth_mechanisms\nfor more detailed information. A red or yellow icon\nindicates that ownCloud could not connect to the external storage, so\nyou need to re-check your configuration and network availability. Enable Sharing\nallows the ownCloud admin to enable or disable sharing\non individual mountpoints. Using Self-Signed Certificates\nWhen using self-signed certificates for external storage mounts, the\ncertificate must be imported into ownCloud. We recommend\nconfiguring the background job Webcron or Cron\nto enable ownCloud to automatically detect files added to your external storages. ownCloud may not always be able to find out what has been changed remotely\n(files changed without going through ownCloud), especially when it’s very deep\nin the folder hierarchy of the external storage.

Tick the checkbox under\nSettings > Storage > \"Enable External Storage\"\n. Storage Configuration\nBefore adding a storage in a production environment make sure its configuration is correct. To create a new external storage mount, select an available backend from\nthe dropdown\nAdd storage\n. When all required fields\nare filled, the storage is automatically saved. A green dot next to the\nstorage row indicates the storage is ready for use. If there is a connection issue with the target storage, it will be marked as unavailable for ten minutes. User and Group Permissions\nA storage configured in a user’s Personal settings is available only to\nthe user that created it. A storage configured in the Admin settings is\navailable to all users by default, and it can be restricted to specific\nusers and groups in the\nAvailable for\nfield. Adding a storage for users or groups you don’t have access rights to, an error notification will be shown and a red square icon appears on the mount. Mount Options\nHover your cursor to the right of any storage configuration to expose\nthe settings button and trashcan. The settings button allows you to configure each storage\nmount individually with the following options:\nEncryption\nRead Only\nPreviews\nEnable Sharing\nFilesystem check frequency (Never, Once per direct access)\nThe\nEncryption\ncheckbox is visible only, when the Encryption app is enabled. When sharing is disabled, the shares are\nretained internally, so that you can re-enable sharing and the previous\nshares become available again. Sharing is disabled by default. Available storage backends\nThe following backends are provided by the external storages app. Allow Users to Mount External Storage\nCheck \"\nAllow users to mount external storage\n\" to allow your users\nto mount storages on external services."

When clicking the trashcan icon, you delete the\nmountpoint. Detecting Files Added to External Storages\nRescanning S3 for manually added files is not possible\nThe command\nocc files:scan\nor a\nbackground job\ncontaining\nfiles scan\nis only available for POSIX but not for S3 and compatible filesystems. You cannot scan/detect changed files on external storage mounts when you select the\nLog-in credentials, save in session\nauthentication mechanism. You might need to setup a cron job that runs\nsudo -u www-data ./occ files:scan --all`\nAlternatively, replace\n--all\nwith the user name to trigger a rescan of the user’s files periodically,\nfor example every 15 minutes, which includes the mounted external storage. See\nocc’s file operations\nfor more information. Known limitations\nRemoval of the external storage or change of its configuration does not remove metadata entries belonging to the previous storage configuration. Removal of orphaned storage entries can be done manually by using the\nocc files:remove-storage\ncommand."

When you select an authentication mechanism, the configuration fields\nchange as appropriate for the mechanism. The SFTP backend, for one\nexample, supports\nusername and password\n,\nLog-in credentials, save in\nsession\n, and\nRSA public key\n. Required fields are marked with a red border. To re-check it, click the\ncolored icon\nor reload your Admin page. Please refer to\nImporting System-wide and Personal SSL Certificates\nfor more information. See\nPassword-based Mechanisms\nfor more information. This may impact performance of the installation as previous configuration metadata entries get orphaned."
