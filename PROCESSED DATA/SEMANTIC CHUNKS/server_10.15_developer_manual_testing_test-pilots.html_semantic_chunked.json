Also, there will be announcements\nof new releases and preview releases on the mailing list, which give you\nthe possibility to test releases early and to help the developers fix\nthem. As a member of the Test Pilot Team you could act as a contact person for\na particular area to help developers\nfix the bugs you care about\n. How do you join\nJust subscribe to the\ntestpilot mailing list\n. We urge you not to\nput your production data on testing releases unless you have a backup\nsomewhere! Small things\ncan be edited straight on GitHub. Alternatively, just ask on the test-pilots mailing list."

Another benefit is a closer relationship with the developers, because\nyou will know which people are responsible for which parts, and it will\nbe easier to get help. Who can join\nAnyone who is interested in improving the quality on his/her setup and\nis willing to communicate with developers and other testers."

Furthermore, during bug fixing the ownCloud developers often do not have the possibility to reproduce the bug in a given environment, nor are they able confirm if it was fixed. Testing ownCloud before it is released is the best way of making sure it\ndoes what you need. How do you test\nTesting follows these steps:\nSetup your testing environment\nPick something to test\nTest it\nGo Back to step 2 until something unexpected/bad happens\nCheck if what you found is a genuine bug\nFile the bug\nInstalling ownCloud\nTesting starts with setting up a testing environment. You\ncan find instructions for installing ownCloud in the\nManual Installation on Linux\nor\nLinux Package Manager Installation\nPlease note that we are still working on the documentation and if you\nbump into a problem, you can\nhelp us fix it\n. The Real Testing\nTesting is a matter of trying out some scenarios you decide on or were\nasked to test, for example, sharing a folder and mounting it on another\nownCloud instance.
