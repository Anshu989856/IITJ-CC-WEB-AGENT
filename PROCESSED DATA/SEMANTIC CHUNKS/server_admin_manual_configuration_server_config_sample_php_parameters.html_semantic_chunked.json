These custom files are not overwritten by\nownCloud, and the values in these files take precedence over config.php. Default Parameters\nThese parameters are configured by the ownCloud installer and are required\nfor your ownCloud server to operate. Unique identifier for your ownCloud installation\nThis unique identifier is created automatically by the installer. A valid\ninstanceid\nis created when you install ownCloud. 'instanceid' ⇒ 'd3c944a9a',\nCode Sample\n'instanceid' => '',\nAuto-generated salt used to hash all passwords\nThe salt used to hash all passwords and is auto-generated by the ownCloud installer. When defined via the\nOWNCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAINS\nproperty in docker, the values should be\na comma delimited list without white space. Code Sample\n'cors.allowed-domains' => [\n'https://foo.example.org',\n],\nDefine the directory where user files are stored\nThis defaults to\ndata/\nin the ownCloud directory. (SQLite is not available in ownCloud Enterprise Edition)\nCode Sample\n'datadirectory' => '/var/www/owncloud/data',\nDefine the directory where the crash logs will be stored\nBy default, this will be the same as the one configured as \"datadirectory\". Code Sample\n'crashdirectory' => '/var/www/owncloud/data',\nCurrent version number of your ownCloud installation\nThis is set up during installation and update, so you shouldn’t need to change it. Code Sample\n'version' => '',\nShow or hide the ownCloud version information in\nstatus.php\nThis hardens an ownCloud instance by hiding the version information in\nstatus.php\n. Code Sample\n'dbhost' => '',\nDefine the ownCloud database name\nThe name of the ownCloud database which is set during installation. Code Sample\n'dbname' => 'owncloud',\nDefine the ownCloud database user\nThis must be unique across ownCloud instances using the same SQL database. Code Sample\n'dbpassword' => '',\nDefine the prefix for the ownCloud tables in the database\nCode Sample\n'dbtableprefix' => '',\nIndicate whether the ownCloud instance was installed successfully\ntrue\nindicates a successful installation,\nfalse\nindicates an unsuccessful installation. Define the default language of your ownCloud instance\nUsing ISO_639-1 language codes such as\nen\nfor English,\nde\nfor German, and\nfr\nfor French. You can use a comma-separated list of app names,\nso if the first app is not enabled for a user then ownCloud will try the second one, and so\non. Code Sample\n'session_forced_logout_timeout' => 0,\nEnforce token only authentication for apps and clients connecting to ownCloud\nIf enabled, all access requests using the user’s password are blocked for enhanced security. A valid path must be given for this key otherwise errors will be generated in owncloud.log. Code Sample\n'skeletondirectory' => '/path/to/owncloud/core/skeleton',\nDefine the\nuser_backends\napp\nThose need to be enabled first and allow you to configure alternate authentication backends. Code Sample\n'user.search_min_length' => 2,\nMail Parameters\nThese configure the email settings for ownCloud notifications and password resets. Define the email RETURN address\nThe return address that you want to appear on emails sent by the ownCloud server. Code Sample\n'mail_from_address' => 'owncloud',\nEnable or disable SMTP class debugging\nCode Sample\n'mail_smtpdebug' => false,\nDefine the mode for sending an email\nModes to use for sending mail:\nsendmail\n,\nsmtp\n,\nqmail\nor\nphp\n. Code Sample\n'remove_sender_display_name' => false,\nProxy Configurations\nOverride automatic proxy detection\nThe automatic hostname detection of ownCloud can fail in certain reverse\nproxy and CLI/cron situations. Code Sample\n'overwritehost' => '',\nOverride protocol (http/https) usage\nWhen generating URLs, ownCloud attempts to detect whether the server is\naccessed via\nhttps\nor\nhttp\n. However, if ownCloud is behind a proxy\nand the proxy handles the\nhttps\ncalls, ownCloud would not know that\nssl\nis in use, which would result in incorrect URLs being generated. Code Sample\n'overwriteprotocol' => '',\nOverride ownClouds webroot\nownCloud attempts to detect the webroot for generating URLs automatically. For example, if\nwww.example.com/owncloud\nis the URL pointing to the\nownCloud instance, the webroot is\n/owncloud\n. When proxies are in use, it\nmay be difficult for ownCloud to detect this parameter, resulting in invalid URLs. [1-3]$\nCode Sample\n'overwritecondaddr' => '',\nOverride cli URL\nUse this configuration parameter to specify the base URL for any URLs which\nare generated within ownCloud using any kind of command line tools (cron or occ). The value should contain the full base URL:\nhttps://www.example.com/owncloud\nAs an example, alerts shown in the browser to upgrade an app are triggered by\na cron background process and therefore uses the url of this key, even if the user\nhas logged on via a different domain defined in key\ntrusted_domains\n. Code Sample\n'overwrite.cli.url' => '',\nDefine the Web base URL\nThis key is necessary for the navigation item to the new ownCloud Web UI and for redirecting\npublic and private links. Code Sample\n'web.baseUrl' => '',\nDefine rewrite private and public links\nRewrite private and public links to the new ownCloud Web UI (if available). As an example, in case 'web.baseUrl' is set to 'http://web.example.com',\nthe shared link 'http://ocx.example.com/index.php/s/THoQjwYYMJvXMdW' will be redirected\nby ownCloud to 'http://web.example.com/index.html#/s/THoQjwYYMJvXMdW'. Code Sample\n'web.rewriteLinks' => false,\nDefine clean URLs without\n/index.php\nThis parameter will be written as\nRewriteBase\non update and installation of\nownCloud to your\n.htaccess\nfile. While this value is often simply the URL\npath of the ownCloud installation it cannot be set automatically properly in\nevery scenario and needs thus some manual configuration. In a standard Apache setup this usually equals the folder that ownCloud is\naccessible at. So if ownCloud is accessible via\nhttps://mycloud.org/owncloud\nthe correct value would most likely be\n/owncloud\n. If ownCloud is running\nunder\nhttps://mycloud.org/\nthen it would be\n/\n. Now, when the\nfollowing conditions are met ownCloud URLs won’t contain\nindex.php\n:\nmod_rewrite\nis installed\nmod_env\nis installed\nCode Sample\n'htaccess.RewriteBase' => '/',\nDefine the URL of your proxy server\nExample:\nproxy.example.com:8081\n. For migration purposes, this setting is installed\ninitially set to\nauto\n, which is equivalent to the default setting in\nownCloud 8.1 and before. For migration purposes, this setting is installed\ninitially set to \"auto\", which is equivalent to the default setting in\nownCloud 8.1 and before. Please refer to\nhttps://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/files/file_versioning.html\nfor more information. Code Sample\n'file_storage.save_version_metadata' => false,\nownCloud Verifications\nownCloud performs several verification checks. Enable or disable updatechecker\nCheck if ownCloud is up-to-date and shows a notification if a new version is available. This option is only applicable to ownCloud core. Code Sample\n'updatechecker' => true,\nDefine the updatechecker URL\nThe URL that ownCloud should use to look for updates\nCode Sample\n'updater.server.url' => 'https://updates.owncloud.com/server/',\nCheck for an internet connection\nIs ownCloud connected to the Internet or running in a closed network? Code Sample\n'has_internet_connection' => true,\nCheck for a\n.well-known\nsetup\nAllows ownCloud to verify a working .well-known URL redirect. When this switch is set to\ntrue\nownCloud will not verify whether the\nconfiguration is writable. Furthermore, when updating ownCloud\nit is required to make the configuration file writable again for the update\nprocess. Code Sample\n'config_is_read_only' => false,\nDefine ownCloud operation modes\nThis defines the mode of operations. The default value is\nsingle-instance\nwhich means, that ownCloud is running on a single node, which might be the\nmost common operations mode. The only other possible value for now is\nclustered-instance\nwhich means, that ownCloud is running on at least 2\nnodes. The mode of operations has various impacts on the behavior of ownCloud. Define the log type\nBy default the ownCloud logs are sent to the\nowncloud.log\nfile in the\ndefault ownCloud data directory. Code Sample\n'log_type' => 'owncloud',\nDefine the log path\nLog file path for the ownCloud logging type. Defaults to\n[datadirectory]/owncloud.log\nCode Sample\n'logfile' => '/var/log/owncloud.log',\nDefine the log level\nLoglevel to start logging at. The default value is\nownCloud\n. Code Sample\n'syslog_tag' => 'ownCloud',\nDefine the syslog format\nThe syslog format can be changed to remove or add information. Code Sample\n'log_rotate_size' => false,\nAlternate Code Locations\nSome ownCloud code may be stored in alternate locations. Define alternative app directories\nIf you want to store apps in a custom directory instead of ownCloud’s default\n/apps\n, you need to modify the\napps_paths\nkey. url\nThe request path to that folder relative to the ownCloud web root, prefixed with /. This eases upgrade procedures of owncloud where shipped apps are delivered to apps/ by default. '/apps-external',\n'url' => '/apps-external',\n'writable' => true,\n],\n],\nPreviews\nownCloud supports previews of image files, the covers of MP3 files, and text files. Enable preview generation\nBy default, ownCloud can generate previews for the following filetypes:\nImage files\nCovers of MP3 files\nText documents\nValid values are\ntrue\n, to enable previews, or\nfalse\n, to disable previews\nCode Sample\n'enable_previews' => true,\nDefine the preview path\nLocation of the thumbnails folder, defaults to\ndata/$user/thumbnails\nwhere\n$user\nis the current user. For example if\npreviews_path\nis\n/var/cache/owncloud/thumbnails\nthen for a logged-in\nuser\nuser1\nthe thumbnail path will be\n/var/cache/owncloud/thumbnails/user1\n. Code Sample\n'preview_max_y' => 2048,\nDefine the maximum preview scale factor\nIf a lot of small pictures are stored on the ownCloud instance and the\npreview system generates blurry previews, you might want to consider setting\na maximum scale factor. Enable maintenance mode to disable ownCloud\nIf you want to prevent users from logging in to ownCloud before you start\ndoing some maintenance work, you need to set the value of the maintenance\nparameter to true. Please keep in mind that users who are already logged-in\nare kicked out of ownCloud instantly. Code Sample\n'maintenance' => false,\nEnable or disable\nsingle user mode\nWhen set to\ntrue\n, the ownCloud instance will be unavailable for all users\nwho are not in the\nadmin\ngroup. Increase this value if users have\nissues uploading very large files via the ownCloud Client as upload isn’t\ncompleted within one day. Available:\n- sqlite (SQLite3 - Not in Enterprise Edition)\n- mysql (MySQL)\n- pgsql (PostgreSQL)\n- oci (Oracle - Enterprise Edition Only)\nCode Sample\n'supportedDatabases' => [\n'sqlite',\n'mysql',\n'pgsql',\n'oci',\n],\nDefine the location for temporary files\nOverride where ownCloud stores temporary files. Code Sample\n'tempdirectory' => '/tmp/owncloudtemp',\nDefine the hashing cost\nThe hashing cost used by hashes generated by ownCloud. Besides ownCloud apps, this is particularly useful when creating ownCloud themes,\nbecause themes are treated as apps. Code Sample\n'encryption.use_legacy_encoding' => false,\nDefine the minimum supported ownCloud desktop client version\nDefine the minimum ownCloud desktop client version that is allowed to sync with\nthis server instance. The version number seen here does not imply official\nsupport or test coverage on behalf of ownCloud. Code Sample\n'quota_include_external_storage' => false,\nDefine how often filesystem changes are detected\nSpecifies how often the local filesystem (the ownCloud data/ directory, and\nNFS mounts in data/) is checked for changes made outside ownCloud. Change this value only under supervision of ownCloud support. Code Sample\n'filesystem.max_mountpoint_move_attempts' => 10,\nDefine where part files are located\nBy default ownCloud will store the part files created during upload in the\nsame storage as the upload target. Code Sample\n'part_file_in_storage' => true,\nPrevent cache changes due to changes in the filesystem\nWhen\ntrue\n, prevent ownCloud from changing the cache due to changes in the\nfilesystem for all storage. Code Sample\n'filesystem_cache_readonly' => false,\nDefine ownClouds internal secret\nSecret used by ownCloud for various purposes, e.g. If set incorrectly, a client can spoof their IP address as visible to\nownCloud, bypassing access controls and making logs useless! Code Sample\n'upgrade.automatic-app-update' => true,\nEnable debugging mode for this ownCloud instance\nOnly enable this for local development and not in production environments\nThis will disable the minifier and outputs some additional debug information\nWARNING:\nBe warned that, if you set this to\ntrue\n, exceptions display\nstack traces on the web interface,\nincluding passwords\n, —\nin plain text! It’s expected that the web page contains instructions\non how to get a valid demo key to be used in the ownCloud server. If this key isn’t present, ownCloud’s default will be used. Code Sample\n'grace_period.demo_key.link' => 'https://owncloud.com/try-enterprise/',\nOrder of login policies\nThe order of the login policies that will be checked, if any. ownCloud core provides the following list of policies:\n'OC\\Authentication\\LoginPolicies\\GroupLoginPolicy'\nIn order to use / activate the policy, include the name in the policy\norder below, such as:\n'loginPolicy.order' ⇒ ['OC\\Authentication\\LoginPolicies\\GroupLoginPolicy'],\nMultiple policies could be used as long as they are registered (the\n\"SubnetPolicy\" is just an example):\n'loginPolicy.order' => [\n'OC\\Authentication\\LoginPolicies\\GroupLoginPolicy',\n'OCA\\CustomPolicies\\SubnetPolicy'\n],\nThe configuration of the policies depends on the policy itself, so they could\nbe configured in multiple and different ways which are not covered in detail here. If set to true, a daily telemetry report is sent to\nhttps://telemetry.owncloud.com/oc10-telemetry\nIf set to false, no telemetry reports are sent.

This document provides a\nmore detailed reference. Most options are configurable on your Admin\npage, so it is usually not necessary to edit\nconfig/config.php\n. The installer creates a configuration containing the essential parameters. Only manually add configuration parameters to\nconfig/config.php\nif you need to use a special\nvalue for a parameter. Do not copy everything from\nconfig/config.sample.php\n. You can add arbitrary files ending with .config.php in the config/\ndirectory, for example you could place your email server configuration\nin email.config.php. Needs to start with a letter. Code Sample\n'passwordsalt' => '',\nDefine list of trusted domains that users can log into\nSpecifying trusted domains prevents host header poisoning. This parameter reperesents a white list of approved IP addresses and\nhostnames that this server is known by / is used to access it. Wildcards, slash notation and ports are not supported. Please consider that for backend processes like background jobs or occ commands,\nthe URL parameter in key\noverwrite.cli.url\nis used. Wildcards, slash notation and ports are not supported. Code Sample\n'trusted_domains' => [\n'demo.example.org',\n'otherdomain.example.org',\n],\nDefine global list of CORS domains\nAll users can use tools running CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests\nfrom the listed domains. Please consult the documentation before enabling this. Code Sample\n'version.hide' => false,\nShow or hide the server hostname in\nstatus.php\nOptional config option, defaults to hidden. Code Sample\n'show_server_hostname' => false,\nShow the short hostname in\nstatus.php\nOptional config option, defaults to use the gethostname() return value. Code Sample\n'use_relative_domain_name' => false,\nIdentify the database used with this installation\nSee also config option\nsupportedDatabases\nAvailable:\n- sqlite (SQLite3 - Not in Enterprise Edition)\n- mysql (MySQL/MariaDB)\n- pgsql (PostgreSQL)\n- oci (Oracle - Enterprise Edition Only)\nCode Sample\n'dbtype' => 'mysql',\nDefine the database server host name\nFor example\nlocalhost\n,\nhostname\n,\nhostname.example.com\n, or the IP address. To specify a port use:\nhostname:#\n#\n;\nTo specify a Unix socket use:\nlocalhost:/path/to/socket\n. Code Sample\n'dbuser' => '',\nDefine the password for the database user\nThis is set up during installation, so you shouldn’t need to change it. Overrides automatic language detection on public pages like login or shared items. User’s language preferences configured under\npersonal → language\noverride\nthis setting after they have logged in. Code Sample\n'default_language' => 'en_GB',\nDefine the default app to open on user login\nUse the app names as they appear in the URL after clicking them in the Apps menu,\nsuch as files, documents or calendar etc. These appear on the User page, on user’s Personal pages and are used by some apps\n(contacts, mail, etc). Code Sample\n'allow_user_to_change_display_name' => true,\nAllow or disallow users to change their email addresses\ntrue\nallows users to change their email address (on their Personal pages),\nfalse\nprevents them from changing their email address. Code Sample\n'allow_user_to_change_mail_address' => true,\nDefine the lifetime of the remember-login cookie\nThe remember-login cookie is set when the user clicks the\nremember\ncheckbox\non the login screen. Note that the user can still access the page without re-authenticating\n(having valid access) if the timeout has not been reached. If a user uses multiple tabs, closing one of them will likely\nforce the rest to re-authenticate. Users have to generate special app-passwords (tokens) for their apps or clients in their personal\nsettings which are further used for app or client authentication. Browser logon is not affected. Code Sample\n'token_auth_enforced' => false,\nEnforce strict login check with user backend\nIf enabled, strict login check for password in user backend will be enforced,\nmeaning only the login name typed by the user would  be validated. With this\nconfiguration enabled, e.g. Code Sample\n'strict_login_enforced' => false,\nDefine additional login buttons on the logon screen\nProvides the ability to create additional login buttons on the logon screen, for e.g., SSO integration,\nsee the following example structure:\n'login.alternatives' => [\n['href' => 'https://www.testshib.org/Shibboleth.sso/ProtectNetwork?target=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.owncloud.tld%2Flogin%2Fsso-saml%2F',\n'name' => 'ProtectNetwork',\n'img'  => '/img/PN_sign-in.gif'\n],\n['href' => 'https://www.testshib.org/Shibboleth.sso/OpenIdP.org?target=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.owncloud.tld%2Flogin%2Fsso-saml%2F',\n'name' => 'OpenIdP.org',\n'img'  => '/img/openidp.png'\n],\n],\nCode Sample\n'login.alternatives' => [],\nEnable or disable ownCloud’s built-in CSRF protection mechanism\nIn some specific setups CSRF protection is handled in the environment, e.g.,\nrunning F5 ASM. Code Sample\n'csrf.disabled' => false,\nDefine how to relax same site cookie settings\nPossible values:\nStrict\n,\nLax\nor\nNone\n. Setting the same site cookie to\nNone\nis necessary in case of OpenID Connect. For more information about the impact of the values see:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite#values\nand\nhttps://web.dev/schemeful-samesite/\nUse 'strict' whenever possible\nIf necessary relax to 'lax'\nUse 'none' if it needs to be relaxed even further\nCode Sample\n'http.cookie.samesite' => 'Strict',\nDefine the directory where the skeleton files are located\nThese files will be copied to the data directory of new users. Supported backends are:\nIMAP (OC_User_IMAP), SMB (OC_User_SMB), and FTP (OC_User_FTP).

If you do not want to provide any link, replace the URL with 'disabled'. Code Sample\n'lost_password_link' => 'https://example.org/link/to/password/reset',\nAllow medial search on user account properties\nThese account properties can be display name, user id, email, and other search terms. Code Sample\n'accounts.enable_medial_search' => true,\nAllow medial search on the group id\nAllows finding 'test' in groups when searching for 'es'. This is only used in the DB group backend (local groups). This won’t be used against LDAP, Shibboleth or any other group backend. Example:\noc-admin@example.com\n, substituting your own domain, of course. Code Sample\n'mail_domain' => 'example.com',\nDefine the email FROM address\nThe FROM address that overrides the built-in\nsharing-noreply\nand\nlostpassword-noreply\nFROM addresses. If you are using local or remote SMTP, set this to\nsmtp\n. If you are using PHP mail you must have an installed and working email system\non the server. The program used to send email is defined in the\nphp.ini\nfile. For the\nsendmail\noption you need an installed and working email system on\nthe server, with\n/usr/sbin/sendmail\ninstalled on your Unix system. For\nqmail\nthe binary is /var/qmail/bin/sendmail, and it must be installed\non your Unix system. Code Sample\n'mail_smtpmode' => 'sendmail',\nDefine the IP address of your mail server host\nDepends on\nmail_smtpmode\n. May contain multiple hosts separated by a semicolon.

Code Sample\n'mail_smtpname' => '',\nDefine the SMTP authentication password\nDepends on\nmail_smtpauth\n. Specify the password for authenticating to the SMTP server. Code Sample\n'mail_smtppassword' => '',\nRemove the sender display name in sharing emails\nMail notifications about shares include the display name of the sharer in the email\n\"from\" address. This can cause some email filters to block these as impersonation\nattempts. Set remove_sender_display_name to true to not include this information. This option allows you to manually override\nthe automatic detection; for example\nwww.example.com\n, or specify the port\nwww.example.com:8080\n. Valid values are\nhttp\nand\nhttps\n. Code Sample\n'overwritewebroot' => '',\nOverride condition for the remote IP address with a regular expression\nThis option allows you to define a manual override condition as a regular\nexpression for the remote IP address. The keys\noverwritewebroot\n,\noverwriteprotocol\n, and\noverwritehost\nare subject to this condition. For example, defining a range of IP  addresses starting with\n10.0.0.\nand ending with 1 to 3: *\n^10\\.0\\.0\\. When the\nuser clicks an alert like this, they will be redirected to that URL and must log on again. If web.rewriteLinks is set to 'true', public and private links will be redirected to this url. The Web UI will handle these links accordingly. After setting this value run\nsudo -u www-data ./occ maintenance:update:htaccess\n. Code Sample\n'proxy' => '',\nDefine a list of hostnames that won’t be proxied. This option only applies if the\nproxy\noption is used\nExample:\n['specific.hostname.com', '.sub.domain.com']\n. Code Sample\n'proxy_ignore' => [],\nDefine proxy authentication\nThe optional authentication for the proxy to use to connect to the internet. The format is:\nusername:password\n. The username and the password need to be urlencoded to avoid breaking the\ndelimiter syntax \"username:password@hostname:port\"\nExample:\nusern@me\nneeds to be encoded as\nusern%40ame\n.

Code Sample\n'integrity.ignore.missing.app.signature' => [\n'app-id of app-1',\n'app-id of theme-2',\n],\nDefine a default folder for shared files and folders other than root\nPlease note that this setting is skipped for guests and the root folder will be used for such users. Code Sample\n'share_folder' => '/',\nDefine the default cipher for encrypting files\nCurrently AES-128-CFB and AES-256-CFB are supported. Code Sample\n'cipher' => 'AES-256-CFB',\nDefine the file format for encrypting files\nDefine if encrypted files will be written in the old format (\ntrue\n) or the new\nbinary format (\nfalse\n) which has a significant reduced filesize. With binary, only new files are written in the binary format, existing encrypted files\nin the old format stay readable. This\ndoes not apply to external storages. → Never check the filesystem for outside changes, provides a performance\nincrease when it’s certain that no changes are made directly to the\nfilesystem\n→ Check each file or folder at most once per request, recommended for\ngeneral use if outside changes might happen. Code Sample\n'filesystem_check_changes' => 0,\nDefine unsuccessful mountpoint rename attempts\nThis config value avoids infinite loops for seldom cases where a file renaming\nconflict between different share backends could occur. target mountpoint name could be claimed as unused by the filesystem but\nrenaming to this target name will fail due to some other reasons like database\nconstraints. Setting this to false will store the part\nfiles in the root of the user’s folder which might be required to work with certain\nexternal storage setups that have limited rename capabilities. Code Sample\n'max_filesize_animated_gifs_public_sharing' => 10,\nEnable transactional file locking\nTransactional file locking is enabled by default. Prevents concurrent processes from accessing the same files\nat the same time. Mainly relevant for\nvery large installations with many users working with shared files. Code Sample\n'filelocking.enabled' => true,\nDefine the TTL for file locking\nSet the lock’s time-to-live in seconds. Code Sample\n'filelocking.ttl' => 3600,\nDefine the memory caching backend for file locking\nBecause most memcache backends can clean values without warning,\nusing redis is highly recommended to\navoid data loss\n. Code Sample\n'memcache.locking' => '\\\\OC\\\\Memcache\\\\Redis',\nDisable the web based updater\nThe web based updater is enabled by default. Furthermore the content-disposition header will be lost and thus files will be\ndisplayed in the browser rather than downloaded. Code Sample\n'copied_sample_config' => true,\nEnable or disable the files_external local mount option\nSet this property to true if you want to enable the files_external local mount option."

Code Sample\n'session_keepalive' => true,\nEnable to force user logout\nForce the user to get logged out after the specified number of seconds when\nthe tab or browser gets closed. A negative or 0 value disables this feature. The recommended minimum value is 5 or 10 seconds. Using a lower value\nmight cause unwanted logouts for users. Note that this feature works properly if the user uses one tab only. an additional check for email will not be performed. In these cases the built-in mechanism is not needed and can be disabled. Generally speaking, however, this config switch should be left unchanged. leave this as is if you’re not sure what it does. Allows finding 'Alice' when searching for 'lic'. May slow down user search.

Lower values increase search\ntime especially for large backends. Any exact matches to a user or group will be returned, even though less than\nthe minimum characters have been entered. The search is case-insensitive. For example, entering \"tom\" will always return \"Tom\" if there is an exact match. You may need to increase this if you are running an anti-malware or spam scanner. Leave empty for no encryption. Note that the above rule is not valid in every case, as there are some rare setup\ncases where this may not apply. However, to avoid any update problems this\nconfiguration value is explicitly opt-in. The app allows for two settings, a minimum time for trash bin retention,\nand a maximum time for trash bin retention. Maximum time is the number of days at which it is guaranteed to be deleted.

The app allows for two settings, a minimum time for version retention,\nand a maximum time for version retention. Maximum time is the number of days at which it is guaranteed\nto be deleted. Available values:\nauto\ndefault setting. Automatically expire versions according to expire\nrules. This feature CANNOT be temporarily disabled once enabled. There are two options,\ntrue\nand\nfalse\n. It is not applicable to app updates. The primary impact is, that clustered instances won’t download apps from the\nmarketplace and install in one server. Valid values are: 0 = Debug, 1 = Info, 2 =\nWarning, 3 = Error, and 4 = Fatal. The default value is Warning. Specify a size in bytes, for example 104857600\n(100 megabytes = 100 * 1024 * 1024 bytes). There, you need to add a\nnew associative array that contains three elements. These options control enabling and disabling previews, and thumbnail size.

Note that this setting is for displaying\nonly and has no impact on the stored thumbnail / preview quality or size. The scale ranges from 1 to 100, where 1 is the lowest and 100 the highest. It defaults to -1 which is equivalent to approximately 75% of the original\nimage quality. Note that any value over 80 may result in an unnecessary increase of the\ndisplayed image and has larger responses sizes when requesting images,\nwithout much increase of the image quality.

As shipped, the value here is the oldest desktop client that is technically\ncompatible with the server. Lowering this value may lead to unexpected behaviour, and can include data loss. Code Sample\n'minimum.supported.desktop.version' => '3.2.1',\nDefine the suggested poll interval for clients\nSpecifies how often clients should poll the server for changes. The value is in milliseconds. The value is not enforced. Clients may use this value to decide how frequently to check the server for\nchanges. Code Sample\n'pollinterval' => 30000,\nDefine whether to include external storage in quota calculation\nEXPERIMENTAL: option whether to include external storage in quota\ncalculation, defaults to false. The value defines how many unsuccessful mountpoint rename attempts are allowed. Note that setting this to false causes issues with the following apps: Encryption,\nDocument classification, Anti-Virus and Ransomware Protection. If you lose this string there will be data corruption.
