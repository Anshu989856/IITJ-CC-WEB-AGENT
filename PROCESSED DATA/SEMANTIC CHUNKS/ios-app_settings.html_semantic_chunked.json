You will then be prompted to enter, and repeat, a 4-digit Passcode. If a Passcode was set, the file provider extension in Files.app or in other third party apps will be locked too. The file provider presents a UI to unlock the Passcode. Lock Delay\nWhen a Passcode is enabled, the app will be locked every time you change to another application. However, under\nSettings\nSecurity\nLock application\n, you can choose to only lock the application after 1, 5, or 30 minutes, instead of \"\nimmediately\n\", which is the default. Biometrical Lock\nAfter a Passcode has been created, a Biometrical Lock, or Touch ID, can also be used to gain access to the app. To enable it enable\nTouch ID\nin the Setting’s\nSecurity\nsection, and then enter your 4-digit Passcode. The next time you need to authorise access to the app, you will be able to enter either your Passcode, or use your stored biometrical data."
